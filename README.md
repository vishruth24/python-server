## Socket Programming

A server written using python from scratch using socket programming. The functionality of the server is limited as of now! Will surely modifiy it to meet corner cases later :)  
It is a TCP based server!  
Run the server using
`python3 httpserver.py`

Using the browser access the IP address of the server! By adding more html files in the templates folder, you can view them on your browser
